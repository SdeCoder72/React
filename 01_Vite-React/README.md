# Hello React + Vite

This is my very first React project - powered by **Vite**!
Vite is a blazing fast build tool that makes React development even smoother.

---

## What's Inside?

- React app scaffolded using `npm create vite@latest`
- Functional component displaying **Hello React + Vite**
- Uses **JSX**, **ESModules**, and **fast hot reload** via Vite
- Clean project structure with `App.jsx`, `main.jsx` and `First.jsx`

## What I Learned

- How to initialize a React app using Vite
- File structure differences between Create React App and Vite
- JSX basics in a functional component
- How Vite simplifies bundling and improves speed


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
